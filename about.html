            Our story began on October 18, 2022, when two souls, Mert Aksu and Ä°rem SanlÄ±, crossed paths and embarked on a journey filled with love, laughter, and countless unforgettable memories. Ä°rem, with her compassionate heart and brilliant mind, studied psychology, striving to become the best psychologist in the worldâ€”a title she already holds in my eyes. I, Mert, am pursuing a degree in Management Information Systems, set to graduate in June 2025, hoping to carve a path where technology and innovation shape the future. From the very beginning, we found joy in traveling, exploring new places hand in hand, and cherishing every moment together. Beyond being partners, we are each otherâ€™s best friends, confidants, and greatest supporters, finding comfort in shared silence and endless conversations alike. As we dream about the future, we cannot ignore the challenges that come with it. Life in Turkey, with all its difficulties, makes us question and plan every step with caution, yet our determination to build a life together never wavers. Despite the uncertainties, one thing remains certainâ€”we want to grow old side by side, build a home filled with love and warmth, and achieve all our dreams together. Love, to us, is not just about celebrating the easy days but holding onto each other through the storms, knowing that as long as we stand together, there is nothing we cannot overcome.
